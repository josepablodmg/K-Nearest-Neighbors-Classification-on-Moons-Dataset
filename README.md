# K-Nearest Neighbors Classification on Moons Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a project demonstrating K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification on a synthetic 2D dataset generated with `sklearn.datasets.make_moons`. The project explores:

- Dataset visualization
- KNN hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Decision boundary plotting

## Files
- `knn_moons.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full workflow, including dataset generation, KNN training, and visualization.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
